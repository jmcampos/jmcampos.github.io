            Permaculture is a system of agricultural and social design principles centered around simulating the patterns and features observed in natural ecosystems.
            It integrates land, resources, people and the environment through mutually beneficial synergies, and has many branches that include ecological design, ecological engineering, environmental design and construction. Permaculture also includes integrated
             water resources management that develops sustainable architecture, and regenerative and self-maintained habitat and agricultural systems modelled from natural ecosystems.<br>
             One of the founders, David Holmgren, built this system around twelve design principles.

              <h5> No till farming</h5>
              <p>
                Tilling creates soil erosion and releases more carbon into the athmosphere.
                 When tiller tines tear into the soil, they destroy nature’s infrastructure to a healthy soil food web. The undisturbed soil consists of a network of billions of beneficial organisms from bacteria and fungi, nematodes, arthropods and insects, and of course earthworms.
                 Heavy farming equipment compacts soils.

              <h5>Apply mulch in your soil</h5>
              <p>
                Applying organic mulch increases the organic matter in the soil. Microorganisms that are naturally present in the soil degrade the mulch depositing decomposed organic material at the plants’ roots. This organic material provides necessary nutrients and holds moisture in the soil for the plants.

              <h5> Crop rotation</h5>
              <p>
                This is a farming practice which involves growing different types of crops in one location sequentially. This practice reduces soil erosion,
                increases the soil fertility and subsequently crop yield. Soil degradation leads to erosion and biodiversity loss, and it threatens our food supply.

                Planting trees as a way to combat erosion, to provide protection from wind and rain, dramatically improve stability and stop soil being literally washed away in front of farmers’ eyes.
                We need to see more trees on our farm landscape and an agricultural regime supporting multi use sustainable agriculture.

              <h5>Don't use chemicals</h5>
              <p>
                Pesticides and chemical fertilizers change the consistency of soil and destroy organisms that aerate the soil.
                disrupts the natural relationship between plants and microorganisms. Rather than receiving nutrients from the soil and its microbes, plants are force-fed synthetic compounds — often derived from petroleum — that are designed to maximize plant growth and yield. Think of this as similar to feeding a human being a towering pile of pizzas: The plants get more nutrients than they need in a year, and it hardly comes from the most nutritious food.

              One of the main goals of adopting permaculture principles is to empower individuals to be their own producers and move away from being dependent consumers. These techniques are practiced in very different ways globally based on climate and resources particular to the region. While there is variety in the methodology of permaculture practices, the holistic approach remains constant. The easy to remember primary ethics of permaculture include earth care, people care, and resource share.

                      In 2007 a group of individuals, including Pam Warhurst and Mary Clear, created a social movement called Incredible Edible. They wanted a way that everyone could help improve their own community.
                      The answer was food. Everyone understands food.
